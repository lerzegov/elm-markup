{-| We might want to move to a list based ID.

So, when we `indent`, we're actually adding a level.

    Seed [0]

    Seed [1] --indent -> Seed [1, 0]
                            |
                            v
                         Seed [1, 1]


    Seed [2]

Is there a performance issue with allocating a bunch of lists intead of base Ints?

A very common pattern is to

    1. step a seed forward and pass that seed for the next block
    2. indent the same original seed, and pass that to the children

So

    [0]
        -> stepped [1]  (goes to next element by handing the seed back in the parser)
        -> indented [0,0] (handed to child parser to go nuts with)
